Tea Connoisseur
The Place Where Tea Enthusiast Meet
This application is built to show connections based on tea post and reviews. If you and another user have reviewed the same tea, they will show up as a connection. You can add teas to the site and make posts on any tea.
You can edit teas and posts after they have been posted as long as you were the creator and you are logged in.
